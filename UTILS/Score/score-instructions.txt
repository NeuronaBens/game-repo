you must put the files on your app

use SCORE to reference outside of timer.js

put these on your html:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="score.css" />

<div id="score" class="score"></div>

<script src="score.js"></script>



EXAMPLE USAGE:
const SCORE = new Score("score");
SCORE.incrementScore(5);
SCORE.setCssStyle("center", "big");
SCORE.setLeftSideScore("Total Score: ");
// You can use other methods like decrementScore, setScoreFunction, etc. as needed
